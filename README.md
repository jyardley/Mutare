# Mutare
Mutare board game for iOS and iPad

Just recently updated to Swift 5.0(October 2020) and is back on the App Store after a short absence.

This is an iOS creation of a game I created in High School back in the 90s.  Created the Mutare App(known as Mutare1 on the Apple App Store) in 2017.

Basically, it's a UIKit app.  I've done all the artwork and programming.  Was wanting to put an A.I. into the app, but as of yet, not 
sure how to do that.  Also was wanting to one day make it so that people could play remotely with one another.  

All Artwork and programming for the app by Jeff Yardley 2017-???
